Word Count

Write a program that takes words from a text file and prints each one on a separate line of an output file followed by 
the number of letters in the word.  Any leading or trailing punctuation marks should be removed from the word before it is printed.
When all of the text has been processed, display on the screen a count of the words in the file.
